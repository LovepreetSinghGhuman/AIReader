Unlike the factory model, suchgrouping assumes that children vary in development and needs in ways not fully predict-able by age and that children can learn from those who are older and younger. Mixed-aged classrooms have been shown to be effective, as older children have opportunitiesto be leaders and teachers (Montessori, 1979), younger children can benefit from themodeling of older children (Kappler & Roellke, 2002), and teachers are able to providedifferentiated, developmentally-appropriate curriculum to the range of students(Kappler & Roellke, 2002, Lloyd, 1999).

However, there is little understanding of the mech- anisms that link age composition to children’s development. In this study, we examined the extent to which classroom age composition shaped children’s classroom engagement, as well as the mediating role of classroom engagement in the links between classroom age composition and children’s language and literacy gains. The data were drawn from the Teacher Professional Development Study, a study of 895 4-year-olds across 223 classrooms. We found that positive engagement with teachers mediated associ- ations between classroom age composition and children’s vocabulary gains. Specifically, 4-year-olds in classrooms with a greater number of younger classmates experienced less positive engagement with their teachers, which in turn, contributed to smaller vocabulary gains across the year. In addition, being with a greater number of older classmates was associated with lower negative engagement in the classroom. Results are discussed in relation to exploring the critical role of children’s individual-level classroom ex- periences in mixed-age preschool classrooms.",en,have child multiple preschool classroom common practice compo sition show shape children learning little understanding mech anism link composition children development study examine extent classroom composition shape children classroom engagement mediate role classroom engagement link classroom composition children language literacy gain datum draw study yearold classroom find positive engagement teacher mediate associ ation classroom composition children vocabulary gain specifically yearold classroom great number young classmate experience positive engagement teacher turn contribute small vocabulary gain addition great number classmate associate negative engagement classroom result discuss relation explore critical role children individuallevel classroom perience mixedage preschool classroom

Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,1,"overall classroom experience, little is known about what predicts preschoolers’ engagement. From a developmental-ecological per- spective, one possible driver at the classroom level is the age com- position of children in the classroom. Classroom age composition imposes different demands on teachers’ provisions of instruction and activities, and shapes with whom children interact in peer play. These factors may influence children’s interpersonal dynam- ics with teachers and peers, as well as their physical interactions with tasks. Therefore, this study incorporates factors across the classroom- and child-level and seeks to examine the extent to which: (a) classroom age composition is associated with 4-year- olds’ classroom engagement, and (b) children’s classroom engage- ment mediates associations between classroom age composition and their language and literacy growth.

To date, however, much of the focus has been on the overall structural and process quality of classrooms (e.g., CLASS and ECERS, Early, Sideris, Neitzel, LaForett & Nehler, 2018 , Pianta, La Paro & Hamre, 2008 ), which tend to show only weak to moderate associations with chil- dren’s skills gains ( Burchinal, 2018 ). These patterns of weak to moderate associations are perhaps not surprising because individ- ual children experience the classroom differently. Put another way, the degree to which children benefit from high quality classrooms is, at least in part, driven by how they engage with the classroom setting ( Howes, 20 0 0 ). In support of these assertions, an emerging body of research suggests that children’s individual experiences, including the amount and type of teacher instruction and inter- actions with teachers, vary greatly among children in the same classroom ( Connor et al., 2009 , Pelatti, Piasta, Justice, & O’Connell, 2014 , Sawyer et al., 2018 ). For example, Connor et al. (2009) found that the amount of small-group literacy instruction observed for individual children in a first-grade classroom within a 2-hour block ranged from 23 minutes to 43 minutes. The amount of variance in children’s individual classroom experience may be especially large in preschool given that preschoolers spend a significant amount of time in free play ( Justice, Jiang, Purtell, Lin, & Ansari, 2021 ). For example, Vitiello, Booren, Downer and Williford (2012) found that 7%–23% of the variance in preschoolers’ classroom experiences was attributable to differences between children, which was compara- ble to the variance at the classroom level (i.e., 3%–22%). As such, the present study moves beyond the ‘average’ classroom experi- ence and focuses on children’s individualized experience of class- room process quality—their engagement in the classroom.",en,early learning development stuhlman sabol hong pianta burchinal date focus overall structural process quality classroom class ecers early sideris neitzel laforett nehler tend weak moderate association chil dren skill gain burchinal pattern weak moderate association surprising individ child experience classroom differently degree child benefit high quality classroom drive engage classroom support assertion emerge body research suggest children individual experience include type teacher instruction inter action teacher vary greatly child classroom justice oconnell example find smallgroup literacy instruction observe individual child firstgrade classroom hour block range minute minute variance children individual classroom experience especially large preschool give preschooler spend significant time free play justice example downer find variance preschooler classroom experience attributable difference child compara variance classroom level present study move average classroom experi ence focus children individualized experience class room process qualitytheir engagement classroom

Importantly, the ways in which children engage with their teachers, peers, and tasks can be either both positive or negative ( McEvoy, Estrem, Rodriguez, & Olson, 2003 ). As such, prior studies have concep- tualized children’s classroom engagement as 4 distinct constructs ( Bohlmann & Downer, 2016 , Sabol et al., 2018 ). The first dimen- sion, positive engagement with teachers, captures children’s emo- tional connection and communication with their teacher, such as the degree to which children seek proximity to their teachers. The second dimension, positive engagement with peers, refers to children’s initiation and maintenance of positive interactions with classmates, including their successful initiation of conversation and play. The third dimension, positive engagement with tasks, taps into the degree to which children orient themselves toward class- room activities, such as remaining focused on an activity for an extended period. Finally, the fourth and final dimension, negative classroom engagement, includes children’s conflict with teachers and peers and their display of off-task and dysregulated behaviors ( Downer et al., 2010 ). Taken together, these 4 aspects of engage- ment collectively reflect the ways in which children engage with, and experience, the classroom setting.",en,velopment embed social interaction teacher peer conjunction physical interac tion object main resource mechanism child achieve higherlevel skill importantly child engage teacher peer task positive negative prior study concep tualize children classroom engagement distinct construct diman sion positive engagement teacher capture children tional connection communication teacher degree child seek proximity teacher second dimension positive engagement peer refer children initiation maintenance positive interaction classmate include successful initiation conversation play dimension positive engagement task degree child orient class room activity remain focused activity extended period finally fourth final dimension negative classroom engagement include children conflict teacher peer display offtask dysregulated behavior aspect engage ment collectively reflect child engage experience classroom

Importantly, these associations are over and above the effects of global classroom quality, with a 1 unit change in children’s classroom engagement equal to |0.02 - 0.15| unit growth in their language skills and |0.02 - 0.38| unit growth in literacy skills ( Sabol et al., 2018 ).

Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,2,"children’s language and literacy learning through distinct, albeit overlapping ways. For example, children who engage more pos- itively with their teachers and peers have been found to have more positive relationships and experience more dyadic conversa- tions, richer language use, and more individualized learning than children who engage with their teacher and peers less positively ( Hartz, Williford, & Koomen, 2017 , Justice, McGinty, Zucker, Ca- bell, & Piasta, 2013 ). These outcomes are key for children’s lan- guage and literacy learning ( Cabell, Justice, McGinty, DeCoster, & Forston, 2015 , Sabol et al., 2018 ). As another example, children’s sustained engagement with tasks and self-regulated learning, facil- itate their efficiency of internalizing language and literacy knowl- edge ( Bohlmann & Downer, 2016 , Vitiello & Williford, 2016 ). In contrast, children’s negative engagement with teachers, peers, and tasks has been found to result in fewer opportunities for children to participate in activities that involve explicit or implicit language and literacy learning ( Sabol et al., 2018 , Williford, Maier, Downer, Pianta, & Howes, 2013 ). The above-reviewed information suggests that children’s classroom engagement is a multi-dimensional con- cept that reflects essential aspects of children’s individual class- room experiences and plays a critical role in their later language and literacy development.",en,childrens language literacy learn distinct albeit overlap example child engage itively teacher peer find positive relationship experience dyadic conversa tion rich language individualized learning child engage teacher peer positively bell piasta outcome guage literacy learn justice example childrens sustain engagement task selfregulate learn facil itate efficiency internalize language literacy knowl edge vitiello williford contrast children negative engagement teacher peer task find result opportunity child participate activity involve explicit implicit language literacy learn abovereviewed information suggest children classroom engagement multidimensional cept reflect essential aspect children individual class room experience play critical role later language literacy development

In this study, we examine the role of classroom age composition and opera- tionalize it as the proportion of children in different age groups at the classroom level. We focus on this aspect of the class- room setting as a predictor of children’s engagement for 2 rea- sons. First, unlike K-12, preschool classrooms often serve chil- dren of multiple age groups. According to the national statistics, 47 states allow preschool programs to have mixed-age group- ings, and roughly 75% of Head Start classrooms are mixed-age ( Moiduddin, Aikens, Tarullo, West, & Xue, 2012 , National Center on Child Care Quality Improvement & National Association for Regulatory Administration, 2015 ). These states provide varied re- quirements about the expected number of children in each age group and teacher-child ratios, which may contribute to hetero- geneity in the distribution of children in different age groups doc- umented in prior work ( Ansari, Purtell, & Gershoff, 2016 ). Second, recent work has shown that the mixture of ages within preschool classrooms has implications for both teachers’ classroom prac- tices and children’s early learning ( Ansari et al., 2016 , Bell, Green- field, & Bulotsky-Shearer, 2013 , Moller, Forbes-Jones & Hightower, 2008 , Purtell & Ansari, 2018 , Yeomans-Maldonado, Justice, & Lo- gan, 2019 ). For example, 4-year-olds who were enrolled in class- rooms with more 3-year-olds demonstrated smaller gains in aca- demic skills ( Ansari et al., 2016 ). Notwithstanding the widespread use of mixed-age classrooms and its connection with children’s early learning, we know little about what is needed to ensure that mixed-age classrooms successfully meet the needs of all children. Thus, this study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by examining children’s classroom engagement as a potential mechanism. Below, we highlight evidence that suggests age composition may play a role in all 4 types of classroom engagement.",en,ment language literacy development know relatively little predict classroom engagement study examine role classroom composition opera tionalize proportion child different group classroom level focus aspect class room predictor children engagement unlike preschool classroom serve chil dren multiple group accord national statistic state allow preschool program mixedage group roughly head start classroom mixedage west national center child care quality improvement national association regulatory administration state provide varied quirement expect number child group teacherchild ratio contribute hetero geneity distribution child different group umente prior work gershoff second recent work show mixture preschool classroom implication teacher classroom prac tice children early learn field purtell justice example yearold enrol class room yearold demonstrate small gain notwithstanding widespread mixedage classroom connection children early learning know little need ensure mixedage classroom successfully meet need child study fill knowledge examine children classroom engagement potential mechanism highlight evidence suggest composition play role type classroom engagement

These challenges expe- rienced by teachers may, in part, be due to younger children hav- ing relatively lower skills on average, which results in the exposure to less effective instruction for older children in the same class- room ( Wilkinson & Fung, 2002 , Yeomans-Maldonado et al., 2019 ). In particular, this may reduce exposure to richness and variabil- ity in vocabulary and syntactic structure ( Huttenlocher, Vasilyeva, Cymerman, & Levine, 2002 ). Furthermore, studies examining inter- actional quality conclude that teachers who teach younger children or teach in more age-diverse settings display lower-quality interac- tions ( Ansari & Pianta, 2019 , Kuger, Kluczniok, Kaplan, & Rossbach, 2016 ) but engage in more positive interactions with older and better-behaved children ( Vitiello et al., 2012 ). Therefore, we hy- pothesize that children in classrooms with more older peers would have more positive engagement with teachers compared with chil- dren in classrooms with more younger peers.",en,perience challenge provide ageappropriate literacy stimula tion didactic instruction challenge expe rience teacher young child relatively skill average result exposure effective instruction child class room yeomansmaldonado particular reduce exposure richness variabil vocabulary syntactic structure furthermore study examine inter actional quality conclude teacher teach young child teach agediverse setting display lowerquality interac tion kluczniok engage positive interaction betterbehaved child pothesize child classroom peer positive engagement teacher compare chil dren classroom young peer

Developmental studies have long shown that the level of children’s language and literacy abilities, as well as social-emotional skills, largely depend on children’s age ( Skibbe, Montroy, Bowles, & Morrison, 2019 ). As such, children en- rolled in classrooms with a higher percentage of older children are more likely to have interactions with peers who have higher lev- els of language skills and greater peer language resources ( Henry & Rickman, 2007 ), which in turn, contributes to more positive en- gagement with peers. In addition, being with older peers may pro- vide younger children with more opportunities to learn and un- derstand others’ thoughts and use socially desirable strategies to approach peers ( Bandura, 1986 , Park & Lee, 2015 ). With that said, however, previous studies have suggested that a lack of same-aged classmates for the oldest children in a classroom was associated with fewer positive peer interactions ( Slot & Bleses, 2018 ). Thus, it is likely that more positive engagement with peers will occur in classrooms with more older peers than younger peers.",en,engagement peer study long show level children language literacy ability socialemotional skill largely depend children skibbe child roll classroom high percentage child likely interaction peer high language skill great peer language resource turn contribute positive gagement peer addition peer vide young child opportunity learn derstand thought socially desirable strategy approach peer previous study suggest lack sameaged classmate child classroom associate positive peer interaction slot bleses likely positive engagement peer occur classroom peer young peer
Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,3,"gagement with tasks. As illustrated earlier, the average age and skills of children in the classroom may shape teachers’ provision of tasks and instructional support ( Yeomans-Maldonado et al., 2019 ), which may further influence how well children maintain focus and engage in self-directed learning ( Strati, Schmidt, & Maier, 2017 ). Both the provision of developmentally age-appropriate tasks and quality instructional support in the classroom are likely to fos- ter children’s engagement with classroom tasks. However, a larger range of ages in the classroom poses challenges for teachers to pro- vide individualized tasks and instructional support ( Ansari, 2017 ). For example, a recent study by Bartholomew, Yang, Purtell, and Ansari (2021) showed that teachers in mixed-age classrooms serv- ing a larger number of younger children provided fewer writing materials and books on average. In addition, the above-mentioned interpersonal dynamics with teachers and peers resulting from classroom age composition may also ensure emotional security that allows children to better engage in tasks ( Alamos & Willi- ford, 2020 ). Hence, we postulate that children in classrooms with more older peers may display more positive engagement with tasks as compared with children in classrooms with more younger peers.",en,gagement task illustrate early average skill child classroom shape teacher provision task instructional support influence child maintain focus engage selfdirected learn provision developmentally ageappropriate task quality instructional support classroom likely children engagement classroom task large range classroom pose challenge teacher vide individualized task instructional support example recent study show teacher large number young child provide writing material book average addition abovementioned interpersonal dynamic teacher peer result classroom composition ensure emotional security allow child well engage task ford postulate child classroom peer display positive engagement task compare child classroom young peer

As mentioned above, classroom age composition overlaps with the average levels of language and self-regulation skills as well as skill diversity in the classroom, which can shape the amount of conflict children have with teachers and peers and the de- gree of behavioral dysregulation during activities.

Earlier studies comparing the incidence of peer conflict among different age groups indicate less frequent peer conflict and more child-generated resolution occurring among older age groups ( Chen, Fein, Killen, & Tam, 2001 , Raikes, Virmani, Thompson & Hatton, 2013 ). On the other hand, dealing with multi- ple age groups creates challenges for teachers that are trying to be sensitive and responsive to individual needs ( Ansari & Pianta, 2019 , Purtell & Ansari, 2018 ). Indeed, studies have shown that low qual- ity emotional and instructional support may lead children to dis- play more off-task behaviors due to the lack of emotional security they experience ( Alamos & Williford, 2020 ). The lack of responsiv- ity from teachers may even lead children to display disruptive be- haviors to draw their teacher’s attention ( Curby, Downer, & Booren, 2014 ). Accordingly, in the present study, we expect that being in a classroom with more older peers is associated with less negative engagement than being in a classroom with a higher proportion of younger peers.",en,conflict disruption classroom early study compare incidence peer conflict different group indicate frequent peer conflict childgenerate resolution occur group raikes virmani hand deal multi group create challenge teacher sensitive responsive individual need study show qual emotional instructional support lead child play offtask behavior lack emotional security experience lack teacher lead child display disruptive havior draw teacher attention accordingly present study expect classroom peer associate negative engagement classroom high proportion young peer
Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,3,"older classmates may facilitate positive classroom engagement and reduce negative engagement, which may then translate into larger gains in language and literacy skills for children. Studies have documented that classroom age composition, as measured by the proportion of younger classmates or variability/range of chil- dren’s age in the classroom, are associated with children’s lan- guage and literacy development ( Ansari et al., 2016 , Justice, Lo- gan, Purtell, Bleses, & Højen, 2019 , Moller et al., 2008 ). For ex- ample, Ansari et al. (2016) found that 4-year-old preschoolers dis- play smaller gains in language and literacy skills in classrooms with a larger proportion of 3-year-olds, and these negative associa- tions are equal to roughly 2 to 5 months of academic development. Despite these documented associations, the mechanisms through which classroom age composition contribute to children’s language and literacy gains are not yet well-understood. Given the possi- ble influence of classroom age composition on children’s class- room engagement and classroom engagement on language and lit- eracy learning, we test the mediating role of classroom engage- ment in the association between classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains. Due to data limitations and the fact that classroom age composition may matter differ- entially for children at different age groups ( Ansari et al., 2016 , Moller et al., 2008 ), we focus on the experiences of 4-year-olds in mixed-age classrooms to unpack the mechanisms that link class- room age composition with children’s language and literacy devel- opment.

Indeed, mixed-age age classrooms provide younger children the opportunity to model behaviors their older peers exhibit and provide older students with opportunities to scaffold and teach their younger classmates (Lillard, 2016, Winsler et  al., 2002). Mixed-age classrooms also provide students with a greater range of interactions, which is often argued to facilitate the development of a wide range of social skills, including empathy and self-regulation (Lillard, 2016). However, recent studies do not support the notion that mixed-age classrooms are beneficial for older children (Ansari et al., 2016, Moller et al., 2008).

Importantly, we hypothesize that the influence of these inter-actions varies by children’s own age, which is recognized as a “person” characteristic (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006) or a referent status in other peer effects research (Justice, Petscher, Schatschneider, & Mashburn, 2011). For example, a 3-year-old may be positively influenced by the presence of older, more skilled peers regardless of the quality of the classroom they are in, whereas a 4-year-old may need par-ticular contextual supports to demonstrate academic growth when in a classroom with younger peers. Using this frame-work illuminates the potential role of children’s own age as a critical factor in the processes through which age composi-tion and other classroom factors influence their early aca-demic development.",en,focus interaction child proximal classroom context propose children academic socialbehavioral development shape feature preschool context individual characteristic specifically focus interaction contextual characteristic classroom classmate observed quality classroom teacher define qualification importantly hypothesize influence interaction vary children recognize person characteristic referent status peer effect research justice example yearold positively influence presence skilled peer regardless quality classroom yearold need particular contextual support demonstrate academic growth classroom young peer framework illuminate potential role children critical factor process composition classroom factor influence early academic development

To begin, there is substantial evidence that suggests that the classroom quality is an important feature of early child-hood programs (Keys et al., 2013, Mashburn et al., 2008). In general, classroom quality focuses on two domains: structural quality and process quality. Current research suggests that structural quality, which includes factors such as leadership within the preschool, teacher qualifications, and child-adult ratios, is necessary but not enough to pro-duce optimal environments for children to learn and develop in (Burchinal, 2017).",en,room children early learning development depend quality classroom environment begin substantial evidence suggest classroom quality important feature early childhood program keys general classroom quality focus domain structural quality process quality current research suggest structural quality include factor leadership preschool teacher qualification childadult ratio necessary produce optimal environment child learn develop

Because process quality captures the experiential aspect of preschool, including the instruction a child receives and the supportiveness of their teacher, it may modify the associations between age composition and children’s learn-ing and development. Specifically, higher quality teacher-child interactions may be indicative of classrooms that are more effectively meeting the needs of young children of dif-ferent ages (e.g., scaffolding, individual time), whereas lower quality classrooms may be indicative of teachers who are struggling. Thus, higher quality classrooms may alter children’s classrooms experiences in mixed-age classrooms, such as their interactions with their teachers and peers, which prior studies suggest has implications for children’s school success (Henry & Rickman, 2007, Howes et  al., 2008, Justice, Logan, Lin, & Kaderavek, 2014, Mashburn, Justice, Downer, & Pianta, 2009).",en,quality strongly associate children gain language literacy social development compare numerous indicator structural quality process quality capture experiential aspect preschool include instruction child receive supportiveness teacher modify association composition children learning development specifically high quality teacherchild interaction indicative classroom effectively meet need young child different scaffolding individual time quality classroom indicative teacher struggle high quality classroom alter children classroom experience mixedage classroom interaction teacher peer prior study suggest implication children school success justice mashburn justice

In this study, vocabulary development among 130 preschool children in 16 classrooms was examined. Children in class-rooms with wider age variance demonstrated larger gains in vocabulary across the year. This association was stron-ger for the younger children in the classroom and notably, was stronger when the classroom was of higher quality. Presumably, children in high-quality classrooms have more opportunities to have meaningful interactions with their teacher and peers, both of which may enhance the experi-ence of being in a mixed-age environment. The quality of the classroom may thus change the effects of age composi-tion, although it has rarely been examined in this context. However, other related work from Tulsa’s pre-K programs has revealed that there is a large degree of variation in pre-K impacts more generally as a function of classroom instructional quality (Johnson, Markowitz, Hill, & Phillips, 2016), which supports the general notions discussed previously.",en,find mixedage preschool program beneficial couple highquality teacherchild interaction study vocabulary development preschool child classroom examine child classroom wide variance demonstrate large gain vocabulary year association strong young child classroom notably strong classroom high quality presumably child highquality classroom opportunity meaningful interaction teacher peer enhance experience mixedage environment quality classroom change effect composition rarely examine context related work tulsas prek program reveal large degree variation prek impact generally function classroom instructional quality support general notion discuss previously

Variations in these types of activities as well as other teacher-influenced classroom attributes, such as the amount of instructional time, may change the way age com-position influences children’s development. Although pre-school teachers’ education and experience have demonstrated few links to measures of classroom quality (Early et  al., 2007), they have shown modest associations with growth in children’s learning and development (Howes et al., 2008). Furthermore, it may be that the skills gained through prior education and experience provide a specific boost for teach-ers in mixed-age classrooms. These teachers may have more specific strategies, not captured in global quality measures, that enable them to promote development among all children in the classroom such as ways to assign roles in group work that maximize the potential learning opportunities for chil-dren of different ages.

The importance of differentiation may be magnified in mixed-age classrooms as children’s skills are likely to be more vari-able than in same-age classrooms.

With the promise of preschool coupled withits continued expansion, there has been growing interest inunderstanding the drivers of how these programs impactchildren (Duncan & Magnuson, 2013). One such aspect ofamong both researchers and policymakers is age compos-ition, in large part because programs often regulate accessby age. Notwithstanding these regulations, as preschoolexpands and Head Start and state prekindergarten (preK)funds are more often used to serve children in commonclassrooms (i.e., the blending/braiding of local, state, andfederal funds), an increasing number of 3-years-olds arebeing served in classrooms with 4-year-olds, making class-rooms that enroll different age children a more prevalentexperience for preschoolers across the country (Ansari,Purtell & Gershoff, 2016, National Survey of Early Care andEducation, 2012).",en,expansion preschool stem fact program onlyfacilitate children school preparedness beenfound narrow developmental disparity thelife course vandell burchinal pierce promise preschool couple withit continue expansion grow interest inunderstande driver program impactchildren aspect ofamong researcher policymaker composition large program regulate accessby notwithstanding regulation preschoolexpand head start state prekindergarten prekfunds serve child blendingbraiding local state andfederal fund increase number serve classroom yearold make classroom enroll different child prevalentexperience preschooler country gershoff national survey early care andeducation

Classroom Age Composition and the schoolreadiness.pdf,1,"AbstractThe federal Head Start program, designed to improve the school readiness of children from low-income families, often serves 3- and 4-year-olds in the same classrooms. Given the developmental differences between 3- and 4-year-olds, it is unknown whether educating them together in the same classrooms benefits one group, both, or neither. Using data from the Family and Child Experiences Survey 2009 cohort, this study used a peer-effects framework to examine the associations between mixed-age classrooms and the school readiness of a nationally representative sample of newly enrolled 3-year-olds (n = 1,644) and 4-year-olds (n = 1,185) in the Head Start program. Results revealed that 4-year-olds displayed fewer gains in academic skills during the preschool year when they were enrolled in classrooms with more 3-year-olds, effect sizes corresponded to 4 to 5 months of academic development.

In con-trast to the evidence on the effects of teachers on chil-dren, however, the literature on peer effects—and how children’s learning is directly affected by their class-mates—is far shallower, especially during the preschool years. Understanding the role of peer effects during this period is critical because much of the classroom instruc-tion in early care and education programs occurs through peer interactions and whole-group activities as opposed to teacher-directed instruction (Ansari & Gershoff, 2015, Mashburn et al., 2009). The omission of peer effects from past evaluations of Head Start has left a critical gap in knowledge. In fact, classroom age composition may be one of the main reasons why the Head Start program has been documented as less effective for older children than for younger children (Jenkins, Farkas, Duncan, Burchinal, & Vandell, 2015, Puma et al., 2010), although this possi-bility has yet to be tested.",en,peereffect framework justice mashburn justice guide study contrast evidence effect teacher child literature peer effectsand children learning directly affect classmatesis shallower especially understand role peer effect period critical classroom instruction early care education program occur peer interaction wholegroup activity oppose teacherdirected instruction omission peer effect past evaluation head start leave critical knowledge fact classroom composition main reason head start program document effective child young child duncan burchinal vandell puma possibility test
Classroom Age Composition and the schoolreadiness.pdf,2,"peer effects may be important in early childhood class-rooms. One is the direct-effects pathway (Justice et al., 2014, Mashburn et al., 2009). In this pathway, children are directly influenced by their peer’s abilities. From this perspective, one would hypothesize that mixed-age classrooms would be beneficial for younger children but may be deleterious for the skill development of older children. The second is an indirect-effects pathway, whereby teachers modify their classroom practices to accommodate a wide range of skill levels, which can lead to less challenging content and potential disengagement for older children (Urberg & Kaplan, 1986). This pathway is particularly salient when considering children’s behav-ior, as having a wide range of behaviors in the classroom or a high concentration of problem behaviors is challeng-ing for teachers to manage (Yudron, Jones, & Raver, 2014), therefore, teachers of mixed-age classrooms may spend more time on classroom management than on activities that facilitate children’s learning. While both of these pathways for peer effects seem feasible, the evi-dence regarding mixed-age preschool classrooms has been ambiguous, with some studies documenting posi-tive effects (Blasco, Bailey, & Burchinal, 1993, Goldman, 1981, Guo, Tompkins, Justice, & Petscher, 2014), and oth-ers documenting null or negative associations (Bell, Greenfield, & Bulotsky-Shearer, 2013, Moller, Forbes-Jones, & Hightower, 2008, Urberg & Kaplan, 1986, Winsler et al., 2002).

Classroom Age Composition and the schoolreadiness.pdf,2,"standing issues have been limited in a few notable ways. First, these studies have not examined these processes using a national data set, and, therefore, some of the con-flicting evidence may be the result of prior studies having generally used small and localized samples (Blasco et al., 1993, Goldman, 1981, Guo et  al., 2014, Winsler et  al., 2002). Second, although two studies (Bell et  al., 2013, Moller et al., 2008) provided much needed—albeit con-flicting—evidence on the potential outcomes of mixed-age classrooms for low-income children, they relied on teachers’ reports of children’s academic skills. This is problematic because these reports are likely to be biased and reflect teachers’ perceptions of children’s abilities relative to those of their classmates (Guo et  al., 2014, Mashburn et al., 2009), which may be particularly con-cerning when trying to tease apart the achievement of two age cohorts of children. Third, researchers have usu-ally failed to control for other classroom processes and selection factors, thus limiting their ability to draw firm conclusions about class composition. Finally, although restricted-age classrooms may be more effective than mixed-age classrooms (Moller et  al., 2008), it may not always be feasible to separately serve 3- and 4-year-olds in all areas of the country (Veenman, 1995), in other words, mixed-age classrooms are sometimes created out of necessity. Thus, an additional scientific and policy question that remains to be answered is whether there is a threshold or tipping point at which the ratio of younger to older students in mixed-age classrooms has a more deleterious or positive effect for children.",en,standing issue limit notable study examine process national datum conflicting evidence result prior study having generally small localize sample study provide neededalbeit conflictingevidence potential outcome mixedage classroom lowincome child rely teacher report children academic skill problematic report likely biased reflect teacher perception children ability relative classmate particularly concern tease apart achievement cohort child researcher usually fail control classroom process selection factor limit ability draw firm conclusion class composition finally restrictedage classroom effective mixedage classroom feasible separately serve yearold area country word mixedage classroom create necessity additional scientific policy question remain answer threshold tipping point ratio young student mixedage classroom deleterious positive effect child

Forinstance, recent research has focused on the role that young children’s peers may play in facil-itating vocabulary development (e.g., Henry & Rickman, 2007, Mashburn, Justice, Downer, &Pianta, 2009). These investigations of peer effects within preschool classrooms show that thelanguage skills of children’s classmates are a significant and unique predictor of languagegrowth, even beyond effects attributable to instructional quality (Mashburn et al., 2009). Specifi-cally, higher peer language skills were positively related to children’s language outcomes duringprekindergarten, indicating that children may benefit from being in a classroom that, in theaggregate, contains older, more cognitively advanced children and that this is particularly truefor children with lower language skills. Such findings suggest that classroom age compositionmay be an important consideration in understanding factors that influence children’s vocabularydevelopment within early education settings, as it provides information about peer characteristicsin the classroom. For instance, if children’s vocabulary growth is facilitated through theirinteractions with peers, it may be important for younger children (e.g., 3-year-olds) to haveopportunities to interact with older preschoolers, as would occur in mixed-age classrooms thatserve 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds.",en,development preschool child socioeconomic status background order tomitigate welldocumente achievement area vocabulary recent research focus role young children peer play facilitate vocabulary development justice investigation peer effect preschool classroom thelanguage skill children classmate significant unique predictor languagegrowth effect attributable instructional quality specifically high peer language skill positively relate children language outcome duringprekindergarten indicate child benefit classroom theaggregate contain cognitively advanced child particularly truefor child language skill finding suggest classroom compositionmay important consideration understand factor influence children vocabularydevelopment early education setting provide information peer characteristicsin classroom instance children vocabulary growth facilitate theirinteraction peer important young child yearold haveopportunitie interact preschooler occur mixedage classroom thatserve yearold

From these perspectives,interacting with older, more competent peers seems developmentally beneficial to childrenbecause it affords younger children the opportunity to engage in more challenging tasks andtherefore experience greater cognitive growth than children without such opportunities. At thesame time, it affords older children in such settings the opportunity to scaffold younger children,which may also provide benefits. For instance, younger children can enrich their learning byobserving, emulating, and imitating the behaviors of older children (Bandura, 1986), whereasolder children can practice prosocial behaviors (Derscheid, 1997, Urberg & Kaplan, 1986)and leadership skills as they serve as mentors for young children by providing support and guid-ance (Wertsch, 1985).

Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,2,"younger children benefit from being exposed to and modeling thebehavior of older children (Bandura, 1986). In support, Rothstein-Fisch and Howes (1988) found that when toddlers interacted withslightly older peers, the younger children exhibited more complexlanguage and engaged in more complex play in a family childcaresetting. Howes and Farver (1987) similarly found that toddlerswhose play partners were older peers engaged in more complexsocial play.Other advocates for mixed-age classrooms have posited thatolder children, too, may benefit from exposure to younger children(Katz et al., 1990, Lloyd, 1999). For example, in such settingsolder children are in a position to more readily practice prosocialbehavior (Derscheid, 1997, Urberg & Kaplan, 1986) and leader-ship skills (French, Waas, Stright, & Baker, 1986), given theirelevated status in mixed-age group interactions. Chapman (1994)found that older children in a mixed-age elementary school settingserved as mentors for younger children both spontaneously andwhen asked. Although the specific benefits that have been linkedto mixed-age peer interaction have thus far been age specific (i.e.,only relevant to younger or older children), advocates of mixed-age classrooms maintain that the age-specific advantages are pre-sumably passed on as a child progresses through such a program(i.e., younger children will one day be older children in the sameclassroom), and thus an egalitarian ethic is preserved.Further research has suggested additional benefits of mixed-ageclassrooms for all children, regardless of age. For example, re-search by Goldman (1981) has suggested that both 3- and 4-year-olds in mixed-age preschool classrooms engaged in significantlyless parallel (as opposed to interactive) forms of play, relative tothose in same-age classrooms. An investigation by Urberg andKaplan (1986) found that both older and younger children inmixed-age preschool classrooms exhibited greater interactivefunctional play and less parallel functional play, relative to those insame-age classrooms. Rubin, Maioni, and Hornung (1976) haveargued that interactive play represents a more mature level of play,classrooms facilitate more mature play and therefore more optimalsocial–cognitive development.Whaley and Kantor (1992) suggested that mixed-age classroomsmay help to lessen the likelihood of parents and caregivers to makecomparisons among children in terms of development. Instead,mixed-age rooms allow parents to focus on each child’s develop-ment as an individual. As such, mixed-age classrooms may de-crease competition between peers, focusing children instead onmore mastery-oriented goals. Many studies conducted with chil-dren, adolescents, and college students confirm that focusing onindividual standards (i.e., mastery goals) is optimal in terms ofmaintaining both intrinsic motivation and achievement in theclassroom (see Elliot & Dweck, 2005, and Nicholls, 1989, forreviews). Blasco, Bailey, and Burchinal (1993) found that childrenwith developmental disabilities, in particular, were more likely toengage in mastery play when they were enrolled in mixed-agesettings.Whaley and Kantor (1992) further speculated that benefits ex-tend to both children and teachers as a result of the “familyclimate” and continuity of care fostered by mixed-age classrooms.climate encountered when moving between restricted-age class-rooms at larger childcare facilities could be stressful for both the",en,young child benefit expose modeling thebehavior child support find toddler interact withslightly peer young child exhibit complexlanguage engage complex play family childcaresette similarly find toddlerswhose play partner peer engage complexsocial playother advocate mixedage classroom posit thatolder child benefit exposure young childrenkatz example settingsolder child position readily practice prosocialbehavior leadership skill give theirelevate status mixedage group interaction find child mixedage elementary school settingserve mentor young child spontaneously andwhen specific benefit linkedto mixedage peer interaction specific ieonly relevant young child advocate mixedage classroom maintain agespecific advantage presumably pass child progress programie young child child sameclassroom egalitarian ethic preservedfurther research suggest additional benefit mixedageclassroom child regardless example research suggest yearold mixedage preschool classroom engage significantlyless parallel oppose interactive form play relative tothose sameage classroom investigation find young child inmixedage preschool classroom exhibit great interactivefunctional play parallel functional play relative insameage classroom haveargue interactive play represent mature level playclassroom facilitate mature play optimalsocialcognitive developmentwhaley suggest mixedage classroomsmay help lessen likelihood parent caregiver makecomparison child term development room allow parent focus childs development individual mixedage classroom decrease competition peer focus child instead onmore masteryoriented goal study conduct child adolescent college student confirm focus onindividual standard mastery goal optimal term ofmaintaine intrinsic motivation achievement theclassroom forreview find childrenwith developmental disability particular likely toengage mastery play enrol mixedagesettingswhaley speculate benefit extend child teacher result familyclimate continuity care foster mixedage classroomsclimate encounter move restrictedage classroom large childcare facility stressful

However, an empirical investigation intothe perceived stress levels of children and teachers in such facil-ities has yet to be published.alent in mixed-age classrooms relative to restricted-age settings(Field, 1982, Lougee, Grueneich, & Hartup, 1977, Roopnarine etal., 1992, Roopnarine & Johnson, 1984). It seems that in mixed-age contexts, age plays a more powerful role than gender in peerplaymate selection. Thus, at a society level, long-term promotionof gender equality might be better served by more preschoolsmoving toward a greater diversity in terms of classroom agecomposition. Such an argument is highly speculative, as no em-pirical explorations into a relation between preschool classroomage composition and attitudes related to gender equality have beenconducted.Finally, some research has supported the notion that mixed-agepeer interactions occur naturally, outside the classroom context(Ellis, Rogoff, & Cromer, 1981). An observational study by Elliset al. (1981) of 436 children ages 1–2 found that target childrenwere with same-age peers in only 6% of the observations recorded,compared with 55% of the observations involving mixed-age peerinteractions (with children who differed in age by at least 1 year).These findings related to naturalistic social interactions, however,are inconclusive to the extent that this may be because of peeraccessibility or children actively seeking out companionship frommixed-age peers. Goldman’s (1981) research on mixed- versussame-age preschool classrooms demonstrated that—within mixed-age classrooms—age did not significantly influence choice ofnaturally better suited to developing in the context of mixed-agegroups (Ellis et al., 1981, Whaley & Kantor, 1992).",en,teacher child empirical investigation intothe perceive stress level child teacher facility publishedalent mixedage classroom relative restrictedage settingsfield mixedage context play powerful role gender peerplaymate selection society level longterm promotionof gender equality well serve preschoolsmoving great diversity term classroom agecomposition argument highly speculative empirical exploration relation preschool classroomage composition attitude relate gender equality beenconductedfinally research support notion mixedagepeer interaction occur naturally outside classroom contextelli observational study find target childrenwere sameage peer observation recordedcompare observation involve mixedage peerinteraction child differ yearthese finding relate naturalistic social interaction howeverare inconclusive extent peeraccessibility child actively seek companionship frommixedage peers research mixed versussameage preschool classroom demonstrate thatwithin mixedage classroomsage significantly influence choice ofnaturally well suited develop context mixedagegroup
Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,2,"The central argument in favor of restricting the range of age inpreschool classrooms concerns a desire to provide each child withan optimal degree of challenge and the utility of specializationtoward meeting this goal. As such, a criticism that has been leviedagainst mixed-age classrooms in favor of more restricted-age pre-school groupings concerns the development of age-appropriatecurriculum and staff training. Specifically, when teacher trainingand curriculum are uniquely focused on what is developmentallyappropriate for a more restricted age range of children, the qualityof the classroom climate will be higher.rooms facilitate more mature forms of play (Goldman, 1981,Howes & Farver, 1987, Rothstein-Fisch & Howes, 1998, Urberg& Kaplan, 1986), other researchers have found evidence to thecontrary or suggestive of a more complex effect than is oftenhighlighted. For example, Roopnarine et al. (1992) observed moresocial and nonsocial dramatic play in preschoolers attending same-age relative to mixed-age classrooms, whereas more social–constructive and nonsocial manipulative play was seen in mixed-age classrooms. Roopnarine et al. maintained that dramatic playwas the more complex form of play relative to manipulative play,suggesting that same-age classrooms facilitated more sophisticatedplay behaviors.

Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,3,"mixed-age classrooms. For instance, younger children in mixed-age classrooms tended to be involved in a greater number ofnegative interactions. This was attributed to the potential for frus-tration in older children resulting from interactions with less ma-ture younger children. Furthermore, Urberg and Kaplan found thatolder children in mixed-age classrooms were more likely to beonlookers, detaching themselves from social interaction. Similarly,Goldman (1981) found more solitary play and less participation inteacher-directed activities among older children in mixed-ageclassrooms. Urberg and Kaplan speculated that teachers in themixed-age classrooms might have had a more difficult time pro-viding a sufficient variety of activities suitable for keeping chil-dren of varied age and ability interested and involved.Proponents of mixed-age classrooms often focus on benefits toyounger children, but the potential costs to the older children insuch classrooms may sometimes be overlooked. A study of mixed-age elementary school classrooms (children ages 6 to 9 years) byByrnes, Shuster, and Jones (1994) confirmed that both older stu-dents and their parents rated the quality of the academics inmultiage classrooms less positively than that in single-age class-rooms. Despite failing to report any benefits found for older, moreought to pay special attention to helping “more able students inseeing how they benefit from being in multiage classrooms” (p.21). In another observational investigation of play behavior indifferent classrooms, Dunn, Kontos, and Potter (1996) monitoredfamily childcare homes and found that frequency of interactionswith older peers were associated with more complex cognitiveplay, whereas interactions with younger and same-age peers wereassociated with less complex social and cognitive play and lowerreceptive language scores. One lab experiment (Tudge, 1992)compared mixed- versus matched-competence peers (ages 5–9years) working in dyads. The results of this experiment suggestedthat regression in thinking was as likely a consequence of mixedgroupings as was improvement. These results suggest that at leastwith regard to some cognitive outcomes, older children in mixed-age groups may suffer. Furthermore, support for such a hypothesiswas found by Winsler et al. (2002). Winsler et al. studied longi-tudinally one preschool’s transition from two single-age class-rooms (separate 3- and 4-year-olds) to two mixed-age classrooms(combined 3- and 4-year-olds). In this study, statistical interactionswere found between child age and classroom age composition inpredicting task focus in the classroom. Although 3-year-oldsseemed to do better after the change to mixed-age classrooms,4-year-olds were observed to be less focused and goal directed.Moreover, children of both ages were observed demonstratingsignificantly more overt positive affect (e.g., smiles and laughter)and less neutral affect in the single-age classrooms compared withthe mixed-aged classrooms.The 1995 meta-analysis conducted by Veenman concluded thatthere were no academic or social differences between elementaryschool children attending mixed-age and same-age classrooms.Similarly, Blasco et al.

Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,3,"As noted, many of the theoretical assertions for or againstmixed- and restricted-age groupings are based on the assumptionthat age is closely related to ability. By this token, ability-basedgroupings may be expected to have an influence on developmentaloutcomes similar to that of age-based groupings. Mirroring theliterature supporting the efficacy of mixed-age classrooms, manyresearchers have championed mixed-ability groupings in terms ofbenefits to be reaped by disadvantaged children who are lower inability (Guralnick, 1981, Rogers & Ross, 1986, Tach & Fargas,2006). For example, Tach and Fargas (2006) found that within kin-dergarten and first-grade classrooms in which ability-based groupingswere used, placement into a higher ability group exerted a uni-formly positive effect on student learning-related behavior andreading achievement. Typically, these studies have implicitly as-sumed that the costs for higher ability children in such mixed-ability groupings are negligible, although several exceptions (e.g.,Guralnick, 1981) have reported no detrimental impact on higherability children in mixed-ability groupings. Nevertheless, a themethat runs through these studies advocating for mixed-ability group-ings is that an important and focal goal is ensuring that the needsof students who have experienced situations that place them at riskor are disadvantageous for their academic development are met.From an entirely different perspective, some researchers haveadvocated expressly for the interests of the most gifted and tal-ented children. Researchers focused on those children higher inability tend to advocate for more restricted-ability groupings, suchthat high-ability children have more opportunities to interact withpeers of similar ability (e.g., Gallagher, 1986). To summarize, as isthe case in the literature focused on age-related groupings, theliterature on ability-related groupings is mixed, furthermore, themost controversial aspect of the debate concerns those children inmixed contexts who are older, higher in ability, or both.",en,note theoretical assertion againstmixe restrictedage grouping base assumptionthat closely relate ability token abilitybasedgrouping expect influence developmentaloutcome similar agebase grouping mirror theliterature support efficacy mixedage classroom manyresearcher champion mixedability grouping term ofbenefit reap disadvantaged child inability fargas example find kindergarten firstgrade classroom abilitybase groupingswere placement high ability group exert uniformly positive effect student learningrelate behavior andreading achievement typically study implicitly assume cost high ability child mixedability grouping negligible exception egguralnick report detrimental impact higherability child mixedability grouping themethat study advocate mixedability grouping important focal goal ensure needsof student experience situation place riskor disadvantageous academic development metfrom entirely different perspective researcher haveadvocate expressly interest gifted talented child researcher focus child high inability tend advocate restrictedability grouping suchthat highability child opportunity interact withpeer similar ability summarize isthe case literature focus agerelate grouping theliterature abilityrelated grouping furthermore themost controversial aspect debate concern child inmixed context high ability
Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,3,"Many of the studies that have expressly focused on classroomage composition have targeted an elementary school population,which makes it difficult to extend the conclusions to preschoolclassrooms (e.g., Chapman, 1994, French et al., 1986, Veenman,1995). Early childhood (ages 2 to 5) is a period of relatively rapiddevelopment, thus, the impact of age differences in classroomcomposition within this range is likely to be magnified, if notdistinctly different, in preschool classrooms relative to that foundin elementary school settings among older children.Furthermore, as Winsler et al. (2002, p. 306) pointed out, “mostof the (extant) research exploring the effects of age-compositionon children’s peer interactions has been conducted in laboratory orquasi-laboratory settings.” In other words, with few exceptions, theextant literature lacks empirical research on preschool classroomage composition conducted in preschool classrooms.

"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",3,"Abstract: Theorists and researchers have conflicting opinions and findings regarding the role of mixed-age classrooms in preschool education. According to Piaget interactions with peers of the same age are preferable, since children closer in age are more likely to learn in similar ways. However, Vygotsky believed that interactions among children of different ages provide an optimal context for development. The present study aimed at assessing whether mixed or same-age classroom status affects the quality of peer interactions, teacher-child interactions, and children’s behaviors in the preschool classroom. Data from 308 teachers placed in three, four, and mixed three- and four-year-old classrooms, serving children from low socio-economic status in urban preschools, was analyzed using General Linear Models (GLM). The results have shown that in mixed-age classrooms, teachers reported lower levels of conflicts in peer interactions (F (1, 302) = 9.92, p = .0001), lower levels of negative teacher-child interactions (F (1, 302) = 6.13, p = .002), and marginally lower levels of challenging behaviors than in same-age classrooms (F (1,302) = 3.41, p = .06).

"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",4,"Vygotsky (1978) proposed that children in mixed-aged groups gain social skills during the process of “scaffolding,” in which a more competent individual supports the learning process of a less competent one, through social interactions and modeling. Through scaffolding, older children have the opportunity to develop confidence and leadership skills, while younger children learn social and language skills from more competent peers. Researchers have found support for Vygotsky’s ideas. For example, Rothstein-Fisher and Howes (1988) found that younger children in mixed-age classrooms displayed more complex language use because of their interactions with older children, as compared to children in same-age classrooms. Similarly, they found that younger children displayed more complex social and dramatic play skills as a result of their interactions with older children. Studies have also found several advantages for older children in mixed-age classrooms. For example, Hercheid (1997) found that interacting with younger children resulted in older children displaying more pro-social behaviors and empathy. Likewise, French et al. (1986) found that older children in mixed-age classrooms display more leadership skills. Lastly, research has found that in mixed-age classrooms, older children had the opportunity to develop mentorship skills (Moller et al. 2008).",en,propose child mixedaged group gain social skill process scaffolding competent individual support learning process competent social interaction modeling scaffolding child opportunity develop confidence leadership skill young child learn social language skill competent peer researcher find support idea example find young child mixedage classroom display complex language interaction child compare child sameage classroom similarly find young child display complex social dramatic play skill result interaction child studies find advantage child mixedage classroom example find interact young child result child display prosocial behavior empathy likewise find child mixedage classroom display leadership skill lastly research find mixedage classroom child opportunity develop mentorship skill

Similarly, in mixed-age classrooms, parents and teachers made less comparisons based on age and focused more on children as individuals (Whale and Kantor 1992). This resulted in a decrease in competition among peers and a focus on mastery-oriented goals.

"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",5,"Social processes, such as peer interactions and teacher-child interactions, represent a cornerstone of early childhood education. Promoting an environment that supports these processes is considered to be a priority to preschool educators. Classroom age composition might play an important role in the way children interact with each other, in the way teachers interact with children, and correspondingly, in the behavioral outcomes of children in the classroom. Positive peer interactions play a key developmental role in preschool, and they predict a positive perception of school, better adjustment to kindergarten, and positive academic outcomes in elementary and high school. On the other hand, poor interactions with peers in preschool are associated with lower academic performance and emotional maladjustment (McWayne, Fantuzzo, and McDermott 2004). In addition, peer interactions are especially important for children in low-income urban areas who experience several challenges, and these interactions have been shown to be a protective factor by helping children become resilient in the face of cumulative adversity (Hampton and Fantuzzo 2003).",en,social process peer interaction teacherchild interaction represent cornerstone early childhood education promote environment support process consider priority preschool educator classroom composition play important role child interact teacher interact child correspondingly behavioral outcome child classroom positive peer interaction play developmental role preschool predict positive perception school well adjustment kindergarten positive academic outcome elementary high school hand poor interaction peer preschool associate academic performance emotional maladjustment addition peer interaction especially important child lowincome urban area experience challenge interaction show protective factor help child resilient face cumulative adversity

The preschool teacher is generally the first adult-child interaction outside of the family. Positive teacher-child relationships help children develop social skills to negotiate challenging situations and help children have a more positive perception of school (Moritz Rudasill and Rimm-Kaufman 2009). Positive teacher-child interactions in preschool have a positive influence on children’s language, academic performance, and social competence in elementary school (McWayne et al. 2004). A child’s ability to respond to social demands with appropriate behavior is a skill developed during the preschool years. By the end of the fifth year of life, the level of a child’s ability to control and moderate his or her behavior in response to social situations remains stable for the rest of his or her development (Raikes et al. 2007). On the other hand, challenging behaviors are some of the biggest concerns of preschool teachers, as behavior plays a central role in children’s ability to transition and adjust to school and succeed academically. Furthermore, most teachers consider behavior a bigger challenge in early education than a lack of academic skill. For example, Rimm-Kaufman, Pianta, and Cox (2000) found in a national representative group of kindergarten teachers in the United States, most teachers considered problem behaviors a bigger challenge in children’s adjustment to kindergarten than academic competency. This finding points to the importance of looking at the preschool years as a key developmental stage to preventing challenging behaviors.",en,preschool classroom preschool teacher generally adultchild interaction outside family positive teacherchild relationship help child develop social skill negotiate challenge situation help child positive perception school teacherchild interaction preschool positive influence children language academic performance social competence elementary school mcwayne childs ability respond social demand appropriate behavior skill develop life level childs ability control moderate behavior response social situation remain stable rest development hand challenge behavior concern preschool teacher behavior play central role children ability transition adjust school succeed academically furthermore teacher consider behavior challenge early education lack academic skill example find national representative group kindergarten teacher teacher consider problem behavior challenge children adjustment kindergarten academic competency finding point importance look developmental stage prevent challenging behavior

The overarching framework forour work is based on Bronfenbrenner's bioecological theory, whichemphasizes the importance of contextual influences on children's earlylearning and development (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006). In linewith this theory, the current investigation considers how specificproximal processes within Head Start classrooms—age composition andteacher continuity—can influence children's academic achievement.Bandura's (1986) social learning theory and Vygotsky's (1978) theory ofcognitive development also shape our developmental framework forthis study as they both contend that one of the primary mechanismsthrough which development occurs in early childhood programs isthrough interactions between children and their classmates. Youngerchildren can observe older and more skilled children in the classroomand mimic their behaviors and actions and older children can scaffoldyounger children who, in turn, can cement their own skills andknowledge. When taken together, these transactional processes amongpeers can constitute one of the key mechanisms through which earlychildhood programs impact children's academic and social-behavioraldevelopment (e.g., Henry & Rickman, 2007, Justice, Logan, Lin, &Kaderavek, 2014, Mashburn, Justice, Downer, & Pianta, 2009, Ribeiro,Zachrisson, & Dearing, 2017).",en,composition school year ground longstandingeducational developmental model overarching framework forour work base bioecological theory whichemphasize importance contextual influence children earlylearning development linewith theory current investigation consider specificproximal process start classroomsage composition influence childrens academic achievementbandura social learning theory theory ofcognitive development shape developmental framework forthis study contend primary mechanismsthrough development occur early childhood program isthrough interaction child classmate youngerchildren observe skilled child classroomand mimic behavior action child scaffoldyounger child turn cement skill andknowledge take transactional process amongpeer constitute mechanism earlychildhood program impact children academic socialbehavioraldevelopment justice mashburn justice ribeirozachrisson dearing

The composition of children’s age within a classroom is one such feature, although it is much less studied than other features. Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that children’s development may be influenced by the age range of their classmates. This study examines the relations between classroom age variability on children’s vocabulary development for 2,743 children between the ages of two years, nine months, and six years, 11 months enrolled in early childhood education settings in Denmark. Findings indicate a significant nonlinear relationship between the range of child age within a classroom and children’s vocabulary development, such that classrooms with a maximum age range of 24 months were associated with the greatest gains in vocabulary growth.

Across North America, there are currently numerous efforts at the local, state, and federal levels to improve access to ECE programs for young children to enhance labor-market participation among parents (Lefebvre, Merrigan, & Verstraete, 2009) and to improve children’s development of key cognitive and noncognitive skills as well as readiness for formal schooling at age 5 years (Winsler et al., 2008). Presently, in the United States, about 50% of 3- to 5-year-olds participate in formal full-day center-based ECE (National Center for Education Statistics, 2017), and this number is likely to increase as many cities and states press for expanded access to ECE for young children. In some countries within the European Union, universal participation in ECE is the norm, including France, Spain, and Belgium, which each have near saturation of children in ECE by three years of age, with an average participation rate of about 80% among the EU 27 [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2016].

For example, state-sponsored support of ECE programs might stipulate a 1:9 teacher-child ratio with a maximum class size of 18 children, and provision of programming by teachers with at least a bachelor’s degree. An additional structural feature often affected by policies is the age composition of ECE classrooms, as creation/expansion policies often stipulate the age range of children who can participate in subsidized programming. For instance, the Commonwealth of Virginia’s long-running Virginia Preschool Initiative (VPI) provides funding for more than 10,000 4-year-olds across the state to participate in center-based ECE each year (Huang, Invernizzi, & Drake, 2012).

Average class sizes have risen throughoutthe country, although there are great differences between, and even within,communities. In the early 1980s, it was rare to have more than 15 children in aclass. In 1993, one third of classes had at least 18 children. Simultaneously withthe increase in classes, the number of employees in child care centers decreased.During the 1980s, there were, on average, four children per full-time employee.In 1993, the number of children per full-time employee had increased to as muchas six (Lidholt & Norrman, 1994). New laws have also had a significant impacton the Swedish child care system. Until 1991, profit-run child care centers couldnot, based on Swedish law, receive public funding. The average annual cost forone child in public agencies was about $10,000 US in 1993.

Conversely, in a profit-oriented organiza-tion, such as profit child care, in which parents cannot directly evaluate the qualityof the services the children actually receive and the children are not qualified toevaluate the services themselves, there are motivation and legal sanctions topromote increased profit. Accordingly, profit firms are more likely to cut costs andreduce quality. Based on this reasoning, nonprofit child care centers are likely tobe superior in quality relative to profit child care centers. Research does notconsistently verify this assumption, however (Cost, Quality & Child OutcomeStudy Team, 1995, Kagan, 1991, Penn, 1995). Although profit child care centershave been characterized by lower adult:child ratios, they generally have a better-trained staff (Kagan, 1991, Penn, 1995).

Such contradictory findings suggestthe importance of other predictors of child care quality. For instance, a strongconsensus among teachers and their aides involves the idea that educational goalsand the means to accomplish these goals could compensate for a decreasedadult:child ratio. This interpretation is consistent with the findings of Russel(1990) and Palme´rus and Ha¨gglund (1987). Variation in teacher education andexperience are also likely relevant in explaining child care quality (Clarke-Stewartet al., 1994).

Manystudies have been devoted to the quality of professional child care and its effects on the children’s well-being anddevelopment (for reviews see Lamb, 1998, Vandell & Wolfe, 2000). Nevertheless, what determines the quality ofcaregiving behavior in professionals involved in the care of young children remains unclear. Ample studies havebeen dedicated to the explication of individual differences in parental caregiving behavior and many were inspired byBelsky’s (1984) seminal model of the determinants of parenting. The model assumes parenting to be shaped by multipledeterminants in three domains: (1) parental personality or personal psychological resources, (2) child characteristics,and (3) contextual sources of stress and support. Because there was no theoretical model available for professionalcaregiving, Belsky’s model was used as a guideline for our choice of potential determinants. In keeping with themodel, we hypothesized three groups of characteristics to multiply determine the quality of nonparental caregiving:(1) personal characteristics of the caregiver, (2) characteristics of the child care group, and (3) characteristics of thecaregiving context. Before reporting on the present study, we will first elaborate our hypotheses with regard to eachgroup of determinants within the perspective of earlier research.",en,influence aspect child development nichd eccrn devote quality professional child care effect children wellbeing anddevelopment review determine quality ofcaregiving behavior professional involve care young child remain unclear ample study havebeen dedicate explication individual difference parental caregiving behavior inspire bybelskys seminal model determinant parenting model assume parenting shape multipledeterminant domain parental personality personal psychological resource child characteristicsand contextual source stress support theoretical model available professionalcaregive model guideline choice potential determinant keep themodel hypothesize group characteristic multiply determine quality nonparental caregive personal characteristic caregiver characteristic child care group characteristic thecaregive context report present study elaborate hypothesis regard eachgroup determinant perspective early research

Yet, very few studies have examined the effect ofthe personal characteristics of professional caregivers on the quality of their care and those that have, have done sowith a quite restricted focus, i.e., the effects of their depressive symptoms. Similar to the findings in parents, resultsindicated that caregivers reporting more depressive symptoms displayed a lower-quality of caregiving behavior thanthose reporting fewer depressive symptoms (Hamre & Pianta, 2004). In a previous study on the present sample ofprofessional caregivers (De Schipper, Riksen-Walraven, Geurts, & Derksen, 2006), their self-reported general mood(i.e., optimism and happiness) was found to be significantly and positively related with the quality of their care asobserved during a structured play episode.

To date, this has not been confirmed for the Netherlands,which is possibly due to the restricted variance in the educational levels of the professional caregivers working in Dutchchild care centers (De Schipper, Riksen-Walraven, & Geurts, 2006, Gevers Deynoot-Schaub & Riksen-Walraven, 2005,Van IJzendoorn, Tavecchio, Stams, Verhoeven, & Reiling, 1998). In the Netherlands, most child care workers receivethe same general vocational training, which does not specifically prepare them to work with very young children.Hence, much has to be learned from hands-on experience. Therefore, rather than caregiver education, in the presentstudy we expected caregiver work experience to be related to the quality of professional caregiving as has earlier beenobserved by Gevers Deynoot-Schaub and Riksen-Walraven (2005) although this was not confirmed by other Dutchstudies (Van IJzendoorn et al., 1998, Vermeer et al., 2005).",en,care provide date confirm possibly restricted variance educational level professional caregiver work care center riksenwalraven ijzendoorn tavecchio stams verhoeven reiling child care worker receivethe general vocational training specifically prepare work young childrenhence learn handson experience caregiver education presentstudy expect caregiver work experience relate quality professional caregiving early beenobserve riksenwalraven confirm vermeer

This was confirmed in a recent study by Bornstein, Putnick, Suwalsky, and Gini(2006), who demonstrated that the association between age and quality of parenting was particularly prominent amongyounger mothers.

Moreover, they reported a positive relation between higher job satisfaction and lower turnover rates on theone hand and quality of care on the other. Accordingly, in the present study we anticipated quantitative and qualitativeworkload in the workplace to be associated with lower-quality caregiving and, secondly, that supportive relations withcolleagues and supervisors would positively affect the caregivers’ behavior toward the children. Belsky’s postulationhas been confirmed in numerous studies (for a review see Cochran & Niego, 2002). Although we also took the supportexamined this association before, studies in the field of occupational psychology have shown that supportive relationswith coworkers within the job setting boosted job performance in other professions (AbuAlRub, 2004, Beehr, Jex,Stacy, & Murray, 2000).",en,care surprisingly little attention award potential impact work environment professionalchild care provider quality care despite wide recognition demand stress involve thejob find favorable work condition relate higherqualityof care report positive relation high satisfaction turnover rate theone hand quality care accordingly present study anticipate quantitative qualitativeworkload workplace associate lowerquality caregiving secondly supportive relation withcolleague supervisor positively affect caregiver behavior child postulationha confirm numerous study review take supportexamined association study field occupational psychology show supportive relationswith coworker setting boost performance profession

Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,2,"Peer interactions provide opportunities for young children to gain social practice and experience and to build healthy peer relationships, thus, they will eventually and profoundly impact their socio­emotional development (Blerta, 2019). Peer interactions include those interactions between same-age peers as well as between mixed-age peers. However, most preschool classrooms in the world are arranged by age, thus only having same-age peer interactions, which are an important part of the daily routine in early childhood programs. Consequently, young children in the same-age classrooms will be suffering from the lacking of mixed-age peer interactions. This problem is more serious in China, as it has implemented the only-child policy for 30 years and has made most Chinese children the only child in their families (Li et al., 2020). This means that these Chinese only children have been deprived of the opportunities of having mixed-age peer interactions at home and in preschool, which will unfortu­nately and negatively impact their social development (Zhang, 2004). Recently, some Chinese pre­schools are trying to promote mixed-age classrooms, thus providing mixed-age peer interactions (Wu, 2017). However, there might be significant differences in the peer interaction patterns between mixed- age (MA) and same-age (SA) preschool classrooms (Wu, 2017). Accordingly, there is an urgent need to explore the similarities and differences in the two types of peer interaction in the Chinese context, thus providing educational implications for implementing the mixed-age classroom policy in China.

Positive peer interactions can help children gain a sense of belonging and security, thus promoting their social communication skills (Ryan, 2012) and psychological adaptability (Boivin, 2005). The existing studies on peer interaction tend to focus on the value of peer interactions, the characteristics of peer interactions, factors that influence peer interaction, and peer interaction skills intervention training.

In MA preschool classrooms, young children of varying ages and developmental levels are placed together following a specific combination model (Katz, 1992). MA classroom promotes the development of self-esteem and self-confidence in older children by providing them with the opportunity to care for younger children. In contrast, younger children are empowered to identify their zone of proximal development and engage in activities beyond their cognitive levels. In addition, older children serve as role models for younger children, thereby inducing younger children to exhibit prosocial behaviors in future interactions with even younger children (Ansari & Purtell, 2018, Lillard, 2016, Winsler et al., 2002).

In contrast, MA preschool classrooms might increase the hierarchical structure and level of complexity in group interactions, while SA classrooms might have relatively equal and comparable young children around the same level. Therefore, peer interactions in MA classrooms can provide opportunities for older children to practice and develop prosocial, self-regulatory, and leadership skills, while younger children gain scaffolds for growth as they receive help from older children (Winsler et al., 2002). Compared to those in SA classrooms, young children in MA classrooms have more play styles, more prosocial behaviors, and tend to depend on peers rather than teachers in daily routine (Howes & Farver, 1987, Mounts & Roopnarine, 1987).

Second, very few studies have revealed the differences and similarities in peer interactions between MA and SA classrooms, especially in Chinese preschoolers. Given that more and more preschools are implementing MA classroom policy in China, it is urgently needed to conduct a classroom observational study to compare MA and SA classrooms’ peer interaction patterns.

Among the many characteristics of a high-quality preschool classroom, one important aspect is the physical literacy environment, which is commonly defined by the reading and writing resources available in the classroom and how they are arranged (Altun et al.,  2018, Guo et al., 2012). Examples of physical literacy materials include books, writing utensils, language-based puzzles, and alphabet displays. Additionally, certain classroom areas may be desig­nated for reading and writing, while areas utilized for other subjects and activities could incorporate these resources (Smith & Dickinson, 2002).

The current study focuses on four emergent literacy skills that have been highlighted as the key instructional focus in the preschool period: Receptive and expressive vocabulary and phonological awareness and print knowledge (Lonigan et al., 2011).

For example, children in intervention classrooms that were enriched with literacy objects in targeted play areas (e.g., the cozy corner library) were observed to spend more time engaging in reading and writing activities, incorporate literacy objects in more diverse and functional ways, and use more explicit language than the nonintervention group (Neuman & Roskos, 1992). In another study, classrooms with high-quality classroom physical literacy environments were strongly associated with children’s general literacy interest and engagement in literacy activities. These factors, in turn, predicted their phonological awareness and expressive vocabulary (Baroody & Diamond, 2016). Several studies further demonstrate direct associations between the physical literacy environment and emergent literacy acquisition. For example, Arteaga et al. (2019) found a positive association between engaging with a high-quality physical literacy environment and children’s print knowledge. Similarly, other studies have found that the quality of the classroom literacy area is significantly associated with children’s alphabet knowledge and name-writing abilities (Guo et al., 2012, Zhang et al., 2015) as well as expressive and receptive vocabulary and phonological awareness (Altun et al., 2018).

Given the less formal regulations around preschool in the United States, mixed-age classrooms, which include children of multiple age groups, are widely used. For example, according to national statistics, over 75% of children in Head Start, the largest publicly funded preschool program in the United States, are enrolled in mixed-age classrooms serving both 3- and 4-year-olds (Moiduddin et al., 2012). National data also reveal that roughly 65% of preschool classrooms, including those in publicly funded programs, have over a 12-month age difference between the oldest and youngest children, with 35% reporting an age difference of 18 months or greater (National Survey of Early Care and Education,  2012). These findings underscore the considerable enrollment of preschoolers in mixed-age class­rooms, although the distribution of children in different age groups varies across states and programs (Ansari et al., 2016).

For example, a study of Head Start teachers revealed that teachers often believed that young children should only engage with literacy materials after mastering social-behavioral skills, such as following directions, abiding by classroom rules, and relating to peers (Powell et al., 2008). Teachers’ beliefs about the degree to which children should learn emergent literacy skills at young ages have been found to be positively associated with the amount of teachers’ language and literacy-related instructional practices (Schachter et al., 2016). Therefore, teachers with the above-mentioned beliefs may provide fewer literacy-related materials and spaces when teach­ing in classrooms with a higher percentage of younger children. For example, in a classroom with more 3-year-olds, teachers may provide books with less engaging and complex narratives, and fewer writing materials (e.g., pencils, papers, word cards, templates), and writing dis­played around the room (e.g., signs, posters, charts, and children’s writing displays).

Results indicated that classroom-level problem behaviors, specifically oppositional/aggressive and internalizing behavior, were associated with lower teacher-child interaction quality (i.e., emotional support, classroom organization, and instructional support). In contrast, classroom- level hyperactivity was only negatively related to classroom instructional support.

Researchers and policymakers focus on the roles of teachers (e.g., qualifications, training) in teacher-child interaction quality, however, little work has considered how characteristics of children themselves, including their ability to regulate their behavior, may influence the quality of their schools, despite evidence that children themselves contribute to the classroom environment (Coelho et al., 2019, LoCasale-Crouch et al., 2007, Mashburn et al., 2006).",en,preschool classroom influence level problem behavior display high rate classroomlevel problem behavior negatively correlate aspect teacherchild interaction quality teacher ability execute instructional activity plan time attention devote continuously deal behavioral issue policymaker focus role teacher qualification training teacherchild interaction quality little work consider characteristic child include ability regulate behavior influence quality school despite evidence child contribute classroom environment locasalecrouch

Little research has explored how mixed-age classrooms may be related to teacher- child interaction quality and the relationship between classroom-level problem behaviors and teacher-child interaction quality. Given the developmental trajectory of children’s regulatory capacities during the preschool period and the different expectations for classroom behavior for children of varying ages, these processes may unfold differently in classrooms serving younger (e.g., 3- and 4- year-olds) and older (e.g., 4-year-olds) children.

Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,2,"preschool (Burchinal, 2018, Burchinal et al., 2015). High-quality preschools influence children’s learning and development in various domains, including children’s motivation to learn, socioemotional and behavioral skills, and development of positive peer relation­ships (La Paro et al., 2004, Schmitt et al., 2018). Teacher-child interaction quality is characterized by teachers’ practices and behaviors such as their social interactions with children and instructional practices (Pianta et al., 2008). Three domains of teacher-child interaction quality are recognized as critical contributors to children’s learning and development: (a) emotional support, (b) class­room organization, and (c) instructional support (Hamre et al., 2014). Emotional support is characterized by warm, sensitive, responsive, and individualized interactions. Classroom organization is defined as how well teachers structure and manage classroom activities, routines, and materials to support children’s self-regulation, attention, and engagement in learning. Finally, instructional support reflects a teacher’s use of cognitively stimulating practices with children, such as encouraging problem-solving, higher-order reasoning, and more advanced language (La Paro et al., 2004). To date, a substantial literature has examined predictors of quality at the program- and teacher-level in preschool settings (e.g., Manning et al., 2019, Tout et al., 2006), but rarely has the association with children’s behavior and teacher-child interaction quality been examined.",en,preschool highquality preschool influence children learning development domain include children motivation learn socioemotional behavioral skill development positive peer relationship interaction quality characterize teacher practice behavior social interaction child instructional practice domain teacherchild interaction quality recognize critical contributor children learning development emotional support classroom organization instructional support support characterize warm sensitive responsive individualized interaction organization define teacher structure manage classroom activity routine material support children selfregulation attention engagement learn finally instructional support reflect teacher cognitively stimulating practice child encourage problemsolving higherorder reasoning advanced language date substantial literature examine predictor quality program teacherlevel preschool setting tout rarely association children behavior teacherchild interaction quality examine

In the present study, we examined three teacher-reported problem behaviors: (a) oppositional/aggressive, (b) hyperactivity, and (c) internalizing behavior. Children’s oppositional/aggres­sive behaviors (often conceptualized as a component of externalizing behavior) are characterized by overt hostility, conduct problems, and oppositional defiance behaviors (Whitcomb, 2013). Extant research shows that children who exhibit oppositional/aggressive behaviors are less likely to engage successfully in classroom activities (Moffett & Morrison, 2020, Rimm-Kaufman et al., 2005). Hy­peractive behaviors such as impulsivity and inattention frequently are operationalized as a dimension of externalizing behavior (along with oppositional/aggressive) in preschool (e.g., Montroy et al., 2014, Williford & Wolcott, 2015). However, research suggests that even though oppositional/aggressive and hyperactive behaviors correlate, they are distinct dimensions of problem behavior and have different implications for children’s academic and social functioning (Gustafsson et al., 2018). Internalizing behaviors, such as extreme shyness, social withdrawal, and anxiety, are described as directed towards the self (Whitcomb, 2013). Children who exhibit inter­nalizing behaviors are often unable to form strong peer relationships and are more likely to engage in isolating behaviors and social withdrawal (e.g., Oland & Shaw, 2005).",en,behavior present study examine teacherreporte problem behavior oppositionalaggressive hyperactivity internalize behavior oppositionalaggressive behavior conceptualize component externalize behavior characterize overt hostility conduct problem oppositional defiance behavior research show child exhibit oppositionalaggressive behavior likely engage successfully classroom activity hyperactive behavior impulsivity inattention frequently operationalize dimension externalize behavior oppositionalaggressive preschool research suggest oppositionalaggressive hyperactive behavior correlate distinct dimension problem behavior different implication children academic social function internalize behavior extreme shyness social withdrawal anxiety describe direct self exhibit internalize behavior unable form strong peer relationship likely engage isolate behavior social withdrawal

To conceptualize the role that problem behaviors at the classroom-level may have on teacher-child interaction quality, we draw upon the literature on transactional models, which posits that development is a consequence of the ongoing dynamic interaction between children and their environment (Sutherland & Oswald, 2005). Although we did not test the bidirectional relationship between problem behaviors and teacher-child interaction quality, this underlying theory is necessary to understand a few pathways through which classroom-level problem behaviors might contribute to teacher-child interaction quality.",en,supportive wellmanaged higherquality instructional classroom reduce individual children problem behavior reverse relationship extent children problem behavior influence quality teacherchild interaction quality underresearched conceptualize role problem behavior classroomlevel teacherchild interaction quality draw literature transactional model posit development consequence ongoing dynamic interaction child environment test bidirectional relationship problem behavior teacherchild interaction quality underlying theory necessary understand pathway classroomlevel problem behavior contribute teacherchild interaction quality

Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"burnout cascade theory, teachers tend to feel more negative and stressed when they perceive aggression/opposition behavior in the classroom, leading to anger and frustration because these behaviors hamper their teaching ability (Bosman et al., 2019). Moreover, following the contagion theory, children also exhibit more aggression/opposition when in classrooms with higher levels of aggression/ opposition (Thomas et al., 2011). Classroom-level aggression/opposition often inhibits teachers’ ability to provide consistent emotional support and positive behavior management (Zinsser et al., 2013) and reduces the available instructional time (Long et al., 2018). However, contrary to other prior research, Friedman-Krauss et al. (2014) found that higher levels of child aggression/oppo­sition behavior problems in the fall were related to higher classroom emotional climate in the spring, over and above fall emotional climate and child-, teacher-, and classroom-level covariates.

However, in Bosman et al. (2019), teachers reported using more sensitive practices when responding to individual children’s hyperactive behaviors in the classroom. Teachers’ increased sensitivity for hyperactive behaviors among children may be due to greater awareness about hyperactivity and symptoms of ADHD and when teachers understand what children are not able to or otherwise struggle to control their behavior in the classroom, this may influence the sensitivity of their teaching in a positive way (Chang & Davis, 2009).

It is plausible that the negative association between classroom-level problem behaviors and teacher-child interaction quality may be even more pronounced in mixed-age classrooms than in classrooms serving 4- year-olds where the association may be less pronounced or non-existent. Prior studies suggest that managing a classroom with a wide range of ages and diverse needs can be challenging (Guo et al., 2014) and uniquely stressful to teachers (Friedman-Krauss et al., 2014).

Conversely, more classroom-level problem behaviors in 4-year-old only classrooms may be related to lower teacher-child interaction quality because teachers see oppositional/aggressive, hyperactivity, and internalizing behaviors as inap­propriate for 4-year-olds. In other words, expectations about children in mixed-age classrooms may have buffered preschool teachers against the difficulties of handling more behavioral challenging classrooms.

Three laboratory studies have observed dyads of children grouped according to various ages. Lougee et al. (1977), for example, observed same- and mixed-age dyads of 3-and 4-year-olds. Younger same-age dyads exhibited the lowest amount of positive social interaction, whereas older same-age dyads displayed the most. Intermedi- ate levels were observed in the mixed-age dyads. A similar pattern was observed for mean length of utterance. Task orientation did not differ among the groups. Howes and Farver (1987) studied dyads in which 2-year-olds were paired either with same-age or 5-year-old partners. Toddlers engaged in more social pretend play when paired with the older children. Brownell (1990) observed dyads of 18- and 24-month-old toddlers and found that the younger children were more inter- active and more positive when paired with an older child than with an age-mate. They initiated more, produced more complex initiations, and imitated older partners more than same-age peers. Older children, on the other hand, made fewer initiations in mixed-age dyads, when they did initiate, however, it was likely to be longer and more complex than with same-age peers.",en,young child influence composition group laboratory study observe dyad child group accord example observe mixedage dyad yearold younger sameage dyad exhibit positive social interaction sameage dyad display level observe mixedage dyad similar pattern observe mean length utterance orientation differ group study dyad yearold pair sameage yearold partner toddlers engage social pretend play pair child observe dyad monthold toddler find young child inter active positive pair child agemate initiate produce complex initiation imitate partner sameage peer child hand initiation mixedage dyad initiate likely long complex sameage peer

Three-year-olds in mixed-age groups spent less time in parallel play than 3-year-olds in same-age groups. Within the mixed-age groups, playmate choices were more likely to be influenced by the partner's gender rather than age. Field (1982) observed same- and mixed-age groups and reported that mixed-age groups resulted in more verbal interaction, imitation, and fantasy play.

Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,3,"studies have relied on observations of dyads of children who were not previously acquainted. Because Mueller and Brenner (1977) showed that acquainted tod- dlers were more likely to interact with each other in a sustained fashion than nonacquainted peers, the question is raised of whether this research would gener- alize to the typical day-care or play group context consisting of more children, all of whom are acquainted with each other. The group studies, however, have not randomly assigned children to conditions or standardized observational environ- ments or adult roles. For example, in Field's (1982) study, each same-age group contained 8 children, whereas the mixed-age groups contained 24 children. Goldman's (1981) study required only 80% of the children in the classes to be within the designated age ranges, thus reducing the likelihood of differences between settings. Only two studies were found that included children under 3 years of age (Brownell, 1990, Howes & Farver, 1987). The definition of mixed- age has varied widely across studies, with differences as little as 6 months between older and younger children (Brownell, 1990) and as great as 3 years (Howes & Farver, 1987). The outcomes assessed have varied widely across the studies, measuring effects on domains such as overall social behavior, differenti- ated levels of social play, pretend play, task performance, and task orientation. Although this variability reflects the diversity of possible effects, replication of findings within each outcome domain is essential.",en,study rely observation dyad child previously acquaint show acquaint dler likely interact sustained fashion nonacquainted peer question raise research typical daycare play group context consist child acquaint group study randomly assign child condition standardize observational environ ment adult role example fields study sameage group contain child mixedage group contain child study require child class designate range reduce likelihood difference setting study find include child brownell howes farver definition mixed vary widely study difference young child great year outcome assess vary widely study measure effect domain overall social behavior differenti level social play pretend play task performance task orientation variability reflect diversity possible effect replication finding outcome domain essential

Moststudies on these associations suggest that spending time in high-qualitychildcare has a positive impact on child outcomes (Ahnert & Lamb, 2011,Burchinal, Vandergrift, Pianta, & Mashburn, 2010, Campbell, Pungello, Miller-Johnson, Burchinal, & Ramey, 2001, Duncan, 2003, NICHD, 2006, Tietze et al.,2012, Vandell, Belsky, Burchinal, Steinberg, & Vandergrift, 2010). Childcarequality is considered to be a multidimensional construct that can be mea-sured by assessing both structural and process characteristics (Howes et al.,2008, Layzer & Goodson, 2006, Boo, Araujo, & Tomé, 2016, Phillips, Mekos,Scarr, McCartney, & Abbott–Shim, 2000).

Cumulativeresearch findings in and beyond the USA indicate that process variables areconsistently and long-term associated with children’s cognitive, social andemotional development (Gialamas, Mittinty, Sawyer, Zubrick, & Lynch, 2014,Sylva, Melhuish, Sammons, Siraj-Blatchford, & Taggart, 2004, Vandell et al.,2010). Moreover, childcare researchers emphasize high-quality social interac-tions between caregiver and children as the most important determinant ofthe quality of early education and care (Burchinal et al., 2010, Curby, Brock, &Hamre, 2013, Curby et al., 2009, Howes et al., 2008, Mashburn et al., 2008,Peisner-Feinberg et al., 2001, Wilson, Pianta, & Stuhlman, 2007).",en,level qualification process quality childcare refer dynamic aspectssuch caregiver behaviour interaction caregiver childrenand child curriculum implementation slot leseman verhagen mulder paro viernickel fuchsrechlin cumulativeresearch finding indicate process variable areconsistently longterm associate children cognitive social andemotional development sawyer zubrick lynch sylva melhuish childcare researcher emphasize highquality social interaction caregiver child important determinant ofthe quality early education care burchinal curby brock

The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,4,"peer-group age compositions in the context of early education and childcare,since only a few countries (e.g., Germany, the Netherlands) adopt anextended age range and include children under the age of three in regularpreschool classes (Helmerhorst et al., 2015, Sommer & Sechtig, 2016). Mostprevious studies comparing multi-age and same-age settings focused onchildren’s behavioural outcomes, while research on associations betweenpeer-group age composition and caregiver behaviour is very limited. Overall,research provides evidence that caregiving in mixed-age groups is of lowerquality (Tietze et al., 2013). Sundell (1994) found that age range negativelyinfluenced the quality of interaction between preschool teachers and chil-dren. Teachers provided fewer teacher-guided activities and less elaboratedinstructions in groups with a wide age range. Sommer and Sechtig (2016)have shown that the extension of the age range in the group is a strongpredictor of lower interaction quality between caregivers and children. Toally included the number of children aged under 36 months in the analysisand showed that the presence of even a single child younger than 36 monthsof age had a negative impact on the quality of caregiving (Sommer & Sechtig,2016). This result is consistent with the findings of a Dutch study thatinvestigated mixed-age groups comprising children aged from 0 to 4 years(de Schipper, Riksen-Walraven, & Geurts, 2007). The study indicated that thenumber of infants in the group is a significant predictor of caregiving quality:groups with fewer children aged under 24 months receive a better quality ofcare. A further study in a Dutch childcare context demonstrated that bothcaregivers’ sensitive responsiveness and their educational skills were lower ininfant groups (0–2 years) than in preschool groups (2–4 years) or even inmixed-age groups (0–4 years, Helmerhorst et al., 2015). Some studies recog-nizing age composition as a potential determinant of caregiver behaviour inchildcare centres reported that a higher mean age in the childcare groupcorrelates with higher-quality caregiving behaviour (De Schipper, MarianneRiksen-Walraven, & Geurts, 2006, Kuger & Kluczniok, 2009). To summarize,previous research provides some evidence that a wide age range, highernumbers of infants in the group, and a lower mean group age are allassociated with lower caregiver-child interaction quality.",en,peergroup composition context early education childcaresince country adopt anextended range include child regularpreschool class study compare multiage sameage setting focus onchildrens behavioural outcome research association betweenpeergroup composition caregiver behaviour limited overallresearch provide evidence caregive mixedage group lowerquality find range negativelyinfluence quality interaction preschool teacher child teacher provide teacherguide activity elaboratedinstruction group wide range show extension range group strongpredictor interaction quality caregiver child include number child analysisand show presence single child young monthsof negative impact quality caregiving result consistent finding study thatinvestigate mixedage group comprise child yearsde study indicate thenumber infant group significant predictor caregiving qualitygroup child receive well quality ofcare study childcare context demonstrate bothcaregiver sensitive responsiveness educational skill ininfant group preschool group inmixedage group year study recognize composition potential determinant caregiver behaviour inchildcare centre report high mean childcare groupcorrelate higherquality caregiving behaviour summarizeprevious research provide evidence wide range highernumber infant group mean group allassociate caregiverchild interaction quality

Parents often workpart-time and so choose the days of attendance depending on theirindividual job-related needs, which may also vary from week to week andfrom month to month. Thus, it is possible for individual children to attendchildcare on single days (1 to 5 days a week), in the morning or afternoon,or for the whole day. The majority of children who attend childcare do sopart-time for two or three days a week (Swiss Federal Statistical Office,2014). The average group size is about 12 children, but a significant numberof available childcare places are shared by two or more children (e.g., onechild uses a childcare place on Monday morning, the other on Mondayafternoon). The Swiss Childcare Association, which provides guidelines andstandards on caregiving quality in childcare, takes children’s age and staffqualifications into account when calculating the caregiver-child ratio(Kibesuisse, 2016). The majority of professional caregivers in Swiss childcarehave completed an apprenticeship of three years, which combines two-dayschool attendance and three-day in-service training per week. Caregiverstrainees (i.e., young persons who attend a first year-long internship aftercompletion of mandatory schooling) and apprentices work alongside qua-lified professional caregivers (Perren et al., 2017, Stamm, 2009).",en,start mandatory kindergarten link primary schooladditionally childcare characterize high degree offlexibility term children attendance schedule parent workparttime choose attendance depend theirindividual jobrelate need vary possible individual child attendchildcare single week morning afternoonor majority child attend childcare soparttime week average group size child significant numberof available childcare place share child onechild childcare place monday morning provide guideline andstandard caregive quality childcare take children staffqualification account calculate caregiverchild ratiokibesuisse majority professional caregiver childcarehave complete apprenticeship combine twodayschool attendance inservice training week caregiverstrainees young person attend yearlong internship aftercompletion mandatory schooling apprentice work alongside qualified professional caregiver

In contrast to previous research examining MA and SA grouping, which has typicallylacked appropriate comparison groups, the present study was essentially able to hold teachers,curriculum, location, teaching philosophy, and participant population constant. A total of 7887naturalistic, time-sampled, classroom observations on 47 children attending the two classes wereconducted over the course of 18 months. Children’s goal-directed activity, sustained attention,social affiliation, inappropriate behavior, and affect were reliably recorded using a checklistinstrument. Significant age differences in behavior between the 3- and 4-year-olds in SAclassrooms were typically eliminated in the context of MA classrooms such that the 3-year-olds inMA classes in several ways were more like 4-year-olds in SA classrooms, and 4-year-olds in MAclasses behaved more like 3-year-olds in SA classrooms. The social and behavioral ecology of theMA preschool classrooms changed significantly over time as children became more familiar withone another. Several of the social affiliation advantages of MA grouping that were found (i.e., ageand gender desegregation) wore off over time as the school year progressed. The effects of MAgrouping on children’s social and behavioral development appear complicated.

The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,2,"peer interactions among young children is a worthwhile endeavor for both theoretical andpractical reasons. In terms of theory, both Vygotsky’s and Piaget’s works suggest differentialeffects on children’s cognitive and social development for asymmetric (MA) as opposed tosymmetric (SA) peer interactions (Bailey, Burchinal, & McWilliam, 1993, Hartup, 1983,Piaget, 1932, Rubin, Bukowski, & Parker, 1998, Vygotsky, 1930/1978). Interaction with SApeers (who are more likely to be equal in terms of knowledge, skill, and power) is thought toprovide a unique context for children to engage in and resolve cognitive conflicts with others,thereby stimulating cognitive, social, and moral development (Azmitia, 1988, Piaget, 1932,Tudge, 1992). Interaction with older, more competent children is seen as an optimal contextfor facilitating cognitive and behavioral development according to Vygotskian and sociallearning/cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986, Hartup, 1983, Vygotsky 1930–1935/1978).Interaction with younger children is thought to afford older children an opportunity topractice and develop prosocial, self-regulatory, and leadership skills (French, Waas, Stright, &Baker, 1986, Hartup, 1983, Katz, Evangelou, & Hartman, 1990, Messer, Joiner, Loveridge,Light, & Littleton, 1993, Winsler & Diaz, 1995), and, for older socially withdrawn children,an opportunity to facilitate social participation and social skills (Furman, Rahe, & Hartup,1979, Hartup, 1983). It is important to note in this connection, however, that most of theresearch exploring the effects of age composition on children’s peer interactions has beenconducted in laboratory or quasi-laboratory settings (e.g., placing children of various ages orability levels together in the same room with a task and observing what happens).

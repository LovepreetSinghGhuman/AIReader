The parents felt positively about the multiage structure as well as the social and academic pro- gress their children made. Parents did have concerns that older and/or gifted children were not adequately challenged. The students had similar views. Some children preferred graded classrooms and expressed concerns about  ‘ helping younger children too much ’ ( et al.,   , p. 20). Teachers ’  perceptions of preschool mixed-aged groupings from a post-developmental framework was explored to investigate complexities and issues associated with multiage grouping (,   ). The teachers understood ‘ multiage grouping as supporting children ’ s learning, assisting children in the manage- ment of positive peer group relations, and reducing the stress of working in chronologi- cally-based groupings ’  (p.6).  and  (  ) used a teacher rating scale to examine children ’ s social behaviors in 29 multiage classrooms in  fi rst-to- fi fth-grades. Sixty- fi ve percent were from middle-income families, and thirty- fi ve percent were from low-income homes.

Classroom   age   composition   imposes   different   demands   on   teachers’   provisions   of   instruction   and   activities,   and   shapes   with   whom   children   interact   in   peer   play.

To   date,   however,   much   of   the   focus   has   been   on   the   overall   structural   and   process   quality   of   classrooms   (e.g.,   CLASS   and   ECERS,   Early,   ,   Neitzel,   ,      ,   ,   La      &   Hamre,      ),   which   tend   to   show   only   weak   to   moderate   associations   with   chil-   ’s   skills   gains   (   Burchinal,      ).   These   patterns   of   weak   to   moderate   associations   are   perhaps   not   surprising   because   individ-   ual   chil   experience   the   classroom   differently.   Put   another   way,   the   degree   to   which   chil   benefit   from   high   quality   classrooms   is,   at   least   in   part,   driven   by   how   they   engage   with   the   classroom   setting   (   ,   20   0   0   ).

The   third   dimension,   positive   engagement   with   tasks,   taps   into   the   degree   to   which   children   orient   themselves   toward   class-   room   activities,   such   as   remaining   focused   on   an   activity   for   an   extended   period.   Finally,   the   fourth   and   final   dimension,   negative   classroom   engagement,   includes   children’s   conflict   with   teachers   and   peers   and   their   display   of   off-task   and   dysregulated   behaviors   (      et   al.,      ).

Specifically, higher quality teacher- child interactions may be indicative of classrooms that are  more effectively meeting the needs of young children of dif- ferent ages (e.g., scaffolding, individual time), whereas  lower quality classrooms may be indicative of teachers who  are struggling.

First, these studies have not examined these processes  using a national data set, and, therefore, some of the con- flicting evidence may be the result of prior studies having  generally used small and localized samples (Blasco et al.,  , ,  et  al., ,  et  al.,  ).

Third, researchers have usu- ally failed to control for other classroom processes and  selection factors, thus limiting their ability to draw firm  conclusions about class composition.

In support,  and  () found that when toddlers interacted with slightly older peers, the younger children exhibited more complex language and engaged in more complex play in a family childcare setting.  and  () similarly found that toddlers whose play partners were older peers engaged in more complex social play. Other advocates for mixed-age classrooms have posited that older children, too, may benefit from exposure to younger children (, , ). For example, in such settings older children are in a position to more readily practice prosocial behavior (, , , ) and leader- ship skills (, , , ), given their elevated status in mixed-age group interactions.  () found that older children in a mixed-age elementary school setting served as mentors for younger children both spontaneously and when asked. Although the specific benefits that have been linked to mixed-age peer interaction have thus far been age specific (i.e., only relevant to younger or older children), advocates of mixed- age classrooms maintain that the age-specific advantages are pre- sumably passed on as a child progresses through such a program (i.e., younger children will  be older children in the same classroom), and thus an egalitarian ethic is preserved. Further research has suggested additional benefits of mixed-age classrooms for all children, regardless of age. For example, re- search by ) has suggested that both 3- and  in mixed-age preschool classrooms engaged in significantly less parallel (as opposed to interactive) forms of play, relative to those in same-age classrooms. An investigation by  and Kaplan () found that both older and younger children in mixed-age preschool classrooms exhibited greater interactive functional play and less parallel functional play, relative to those in same-age classrooms. , , and  () have argued that interactive play represents a more mature level of play, classrooms facilitate more mature play and therefore more optimal social–cognitive development.  and  () suggested that mixed-age classrooms may help to lessen the likelihood of parents and caregivers to make comparisons among children in terms of development. Instead, mixed-age rooms allow parents to focus on each child’s develop- ment as an individual. As such, mixed-age classrooms may de- crease competition between peers, focusing children instead on more mastery-oriented goals. Many studies conducted with chil- dren, adolescents, and college students confirm that focusing on individual standards (i.e., mastery goals) is optimal in terms of maintaining both intrinsic motivation and achievement in the classroom (see , , and , , for reviews). Blasco, , and  () found that children with developmental disabilities, in particular, were more likely to engage in mastery play when they were enrolled in mixed-age settings.  and  () further speculated that benefits ex- tend to both children and teachers as a result of the “family climate” and continuity of care fostered by mixed-age classrooms. climate encountered when moving between restricted-age class- rooms at larger childcare facilities could be stressful for both the",en,younger children benefit exposed modeling behavior older children support found toddlers interacted slightly older peers younger children exhibited complex language engaged complex play family childcare setting similarly found toddlers play partners older peers engaged complex social play advocates mixed age classrooms posited older children benefit exposure younger children example settings older children position readily practice prosocial behavior leader ship skills given elevated status mixed age group interactions found older children mixed age elementary school setting served mentors younger children spontaneously asked specific benefits linked mixed age peer interaction far age specific relevant younger older children advocates mixed age classrooms maintain age specific advantages pre sumably passed child progresses program younger children older children classroom egalitarian ethic preserved research suggested additional benefits mixed age classrooms children regardless age example search suggested mixed age preschool classrooms engaged significantly parallel opposed interactive forms play relative age classrooms investigation found older younger children mixed age preschool classrooms exhibited greater interactive functional play parallel functional play relative age classrooms argued interactive play represents mature level play classrooms facilitate mature play optimal social cognitive development suggested mixed age classrooms help lessen likelihood parents caregivers comparisons children terms development instead mixed age rooms allow parents focus child develop ment individual mixed age classrooms crease competition peers focusing children instead mastery oriented goals studies conducted chil dren adolescents college students confirm focusing individual standards mastery goals optimal terms maintaining intrinsic motivation achievement classroom reviews blasco found children developmental disabilities particular likely engage mastery play enrolled mixed age settings speculated benefits tend children teachers result family climate continuity care fostered mixed age classrooms climate encountered moving restricted age class rooms larger childcare facilities stressful,0,"['of', 'the', 'in', 'and', 'to', 'age', 'with', 'classroom', 'children', 'classrooms']"

It seems that in mixed- age contexts, age plays a more powerful role than gender in peer playmate selection. Thus, at a society level, long-term promotion of gender equality might be better served by more preschools moving toward a greater diversity in terms of classroom age composition. Such an argument is highly speculative, as no em- pirical explorations into a relation between preschool classroom age composition and attitudes related to gender equality have been conducted. Finally, some research has supported the notion that mixed-age peer interactions occur naturally, outside the classroom context (, ). An observational study by . () of 436 children ages 1–2 found that target children were with same-age peers in only 6% of the observations recorded, compared with 55% of the observations involving mixed-age peer interactions (with children who differed in age by ). These findings related to naturalistic social interactions, however, are inconclusive to the extent that this may be because of peer accessibility or children actively seeking out companionship from mixed-age peers.

For instance, younger children in mixed- age classrooms tended to be involved in a greater number of negative interactions. This was attributed to the potential for frus- tration in older children resulting from interactions with less ma- ture younger children. Furthermore,  and  found that older children in mixed-age classrooms were more likely to be onlookers, detaching themselves from social interaction. Similarly, Goldman () found more solitary play and less participation in teacher-directed activities among older children in mixed-age classrooms.  and  speculated that teachers in the mixed-age classrooms might have had a more difficult time pro- viding a sufficient variety of activities suitable for keeping chil- dren of varied age and ability interested and involved. Proponents of mixed-age classrooms often focus on benefits to younger children, but the potential costs to the older children in such classrooms may sometimes be overlooked. A study of mixed- age elementary school classrooms (children ) by , and  () confirmed that both older stu- dents and their parents rated the quality of the academics in multiage classrooms less positively than that in single-age class- rooms. Despite failing to report any benefits found for older, more ought to pay special attention to helping “more able students in seeing how they benefit from being in multiage classrooms” (p. 21). In another observational investigation of play behavior in different classrooms, , , and  () monitored family childcare homes and found that frequency of interactions with older peers were associated with more complex cognitive play, whereas interactions with younger and same-age peers were associated with less complex social and cognitive play and lower receptive language scores. One lab experiment (, ) compared mixed- versus matched-competence peers () working in dyads. The results of this experiment suggested that regression in thinking was as likely a consequence of mixed groupings as was improvement. These results suggest that at least with regard to some cognitive outcomes, older children in mixed- age groups may suffer. Furthermore, support for such a hypothesis was found by .

By this token, ability-based groupings may be expected to have an influence on developmental outcomes similar to that of age-based groupings. Mirroring the literature supporting the efficacy of mixed-age classrooms, many researchers have championed mixed-ability groupings in terms of benefits to be reaped by disadvantaged children who are lower in ability (, , , , , ). For example,  and  () found that within kin- dergarten and first-grade classrooms in which ability-based groupings were used, placement into a higher ability group exerted a uni- formly positive effect on student learning-related behavior and reading achievement. Typically, these studies have implicitly as- sumed that the costs for higher ability children in such mixed- ability groupings are negligible, although several exceptions (e.g., , ) have reported no detrimental impact on higher ability children in mixed-ability groupings. Nevertheless, a theme that runs through these studies advocating for mixed-ability group- ings is that an important and focal goal is ensuring that the needs of students who have experienced situations that place them at risk or are disadvantageous for their academic development are met. From an entirely different perspective, some researchers have advocated expressly for the interests of the most gifted and tal- ented children. Researchers focused on those children higher in ability tend to advocate for more restricted-ability groupings, such that high-ability children have more opportunities to interact with peers of similar ability (e.g., , ).

Conversely, in a profit-oriented organiza- tion, such as profit child care, in which parents cannot directly evaluate the quality of the services the children actually receive and the children are not qualified to evaluate the services themselves, there are motivation and legal sanctions to promote increased profit. Accordingly, profit firms are more likely to cut costs and reduce quality. Based on this reasoning, nonprofit child care centers are likely to be superior in quality relative to profit child care centers. Research does not consistently verify this assumption, however (, , , , , ).

Many studies have been devoted to the quality of professional child care and its effects on the children’s well-being and development (for reviews see  ,  ,  ,  ). Nevertheless, what determines the quality of caregiving behavior in professionals involved in the care of young children remains unclear. Ample studies have been dedicated to the explication of individual differences in  parental  caregiving behavior and many were inspired by ’s ()  seminal model of the determinants of parenting. The model assumes parenting to be shaped by multiple determinants in three domains: (1) parental personality or personal psychological resources, (2) child characteristics, and (3) contextual sources of stress and support. Because there was no theoretical model available for professional caregiving, ’s model was used as a guideline for our choice of potential determinants. In keeping with the model, we hypothesized three groups of characteristics to multiply determine the quality of nonparental caregiving: (1) personal characteristics of the caregiver, (2) characteristics of the child care group, and (3) characteristics of the caregiving context. Before reporting on the present study, we will first elaborate our hypotheses with regard to each group of determinants within the perspective of earlier research.",en,influence aspects child development studies devoted quality professional child care effects children development reviews determines quality caregiving behavior professionals involved care young children remains unclear ample studies dedicated explication individual differences parental caregiving behavior inspired seminal model determinants parenting model assumes parenting shaped multiple determinants domains parental personality personal psychological resources child characteristics contextual sources stress support theoretical model available professional caregiving model guideline choice potential determinants keeping model hypothesized groups characteristics multiply determine quality nonparental caregiving personal characteristics caregiver characteristics child care group characteristics caregiving context reporting present study elaborate hypotheses regard group determinants perspective earlier research,1,"['children', 'in', 'mixedage', 'and', 'older', 'play', 'to', 'the', 'that', 'of']"

Yet, very few studies have examined the effect of the personal characteristics of professional caregivers on the quality of their care and those that have, have done so with a quite restricted focus, i.e., the effects of their depressive symptoms.

Most previous studies comparing multi-age and same-age settings focused on children ’ s behavioural outcomes, while research on associations between peer-group age composition and caregiver behaviour is very limited. Overall, research provides evidence that caregiving in mixed-age groups is of lower quality (Tietze et al.,   ).  (  ) found that age range negatively in  uenced the quality of interaction between preschool teachers and chil- dren. Teachers provided fewer teacher-guided activities and less elaborated instructions in groups with a wide age range.  and  (  ) have shown that the extension of the age range in the group is a strong predictor of lower interaction quality between caregivers and children.

# BERTopic with spaCy

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to extract text from PDFs, clean it using spaCy, and perform topic modeling using BERTopic. The workflow includes:

1. Extracting text from PDFs using `PyMuPDF (fitz)`.
2. Cleaning the text using `spaCy`, with support for English, Dutch, and French.
3. Detecting the language of extracted text using `langdetect`.
4. Performing topic modeling with BERTopic.
5. Visualizing topic distributions and key term representations.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy spacy bertopic langid tqdm wordsegment matplotlib seaborn langdetect fitz scikit-learn sentence-transformers pyLDAvis
```
Additionally, download the necessary `spaCy` language models:
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
python -m spacy download nl_core_news_lg
python -m spacy download fr_core_news_lg
```

## Configuration
Modify `config.json` to set the required paths:
```json
{
    "pdf_directory": "papers",
    "cleaned_csv": "csv/cleanedpdfsV2.csv",
    "test_csv": "../test/pdfs/test.csv",
    "test_pdf_directory": "../test/pdfs"
}
```

## Running the Notebook
1. Place PDFs in the specified directory.
2. Run the notebook cells to extract, clean, and process text.
3. Review the generated CSV files for cleaned text.
4. Execute BERTopic modeling to analyze extracted topics.
5. Use the visualization tools to explore topic insights.

## Key Features
- **Advanced Text Preprocessing:** Cleans ligatures, removes unwanted references, and detects language.
- **Automated Processing:** Reads multiple PDFs and exports structured data.
- **Topic Modeling with BERTopic:** Extracts key themes and visualizes topic distributions.
- **Flexible Language Support:** Handles multilingual texts with `spaCy` and `langdetect`.

## Output Files
- `cleaned_text.csv`: Extracted and processed text with language labels.
- `bertopic_model`: Serialized BERTopic model for further analysis.

## Future Improvements
- Implement Named Entity Recognition (NER) for additional insights.
- Enhance language detection accuracy by combining multiple approaches.
- Optimize processing speed for large PDF datasets.
